Here are a bunch of Java classes I wrote to help analyze data for
the Fake Randomness project.

I created a BitString class that implements lots of the tests we used,
then used BitString objects in FullAnalyzer to compile data and write it
to an Excel file (with the help of JExcel).

I also included some sample Excel docs so you can see the results.
